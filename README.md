HR-DATA-ANALYTICS

This project aims to assist the HR team in understanding employee behavior patterns on specific days of the week or throughout the month.

Project Overview
This project is divided into multiple stages:

1. Data Understanding
The dataset covers the period from April 2022 to June 2022 and includes employee attendance data categorized as follows:
- P: Present in the office.
- WFH: Working from home.
- SL: Sick leave.
- WO: Weekly offs (weekends).
- Other categories as applicable.

 2. Data Cleaning
- Date Formatting: Standardized the date column to a consistent format.
- Duplicate Removal: Eliminated duplicate records from the dataset.

3. Data Preparation
- The data was initially spread across multiple sheets, with columns representing dates.
- To consolidate the data:
  - Transformed the date columns into a single column format.
  - Combined data from different months into a single unified dataset.
  - Removed unnecessary data during the transformation process.

4. Dashboard Creation in Power BI
Developed an interactive dashboard with the following key metrics:
1. Total Working Days: Calculated the total number of working days during the period.
2. Total Present Days: Summed up the days employees were present in the office.
3. Percentage of Working Days: Computed the percentage of days worked compared to the total days in the dataset.
4. Work From Home Percentage: Determined the proportion of days employees worked from home.
5. Sick Leave Percentage: Calculated the percentage of days employees took as sick leave.

This dashboard enables the HR team to gain valuable insights into employee attendance and behavior patterns, aiding in better decision-making and workforce management.
